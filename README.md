## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Requirements

1. opencv-python == 4.9.0.80
2. scikit-image == 0.22.0
3. numpy == 1.24.3
4. torch == 2.3.0+cu118
5. Pillow == 10.2.0

7. natsort == 8.4.0
8. torchvision == 0.18.0+cu118

## üß™ 3. Inference
To test the model, follow these steps:


1. Download the pretrained weights from either of the following links, and place them in the `./Models` directory:  
   - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLIrWoW6WEqQDtYNdg-Lx3tGFlYSjavU/view?usp=sharing)

2. Place your images to be enhanced in the ./1_Input directory.

3. Run the code with the following command:

   ```bash
   python inference.py

4. The enhanced images will be saved in the ./2_Output directory.
